Project Brief: Funnel & Growth Analytics Suite

Project Overview

This project delivers a fully integrated, end-to-end analytics solution that replicates the core workflows of a Funnel & Growth Analytics Business Analyst. The objective is to ingest, unify, analyze, and visualize multi-source sales funnel data from leading CRMs (HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive) to drive actionable business insights.
Every step—from API sourcing to dashboard creation—is documented and automated, with a clear emphasis on operationalizing real business KPIs (conversion rates, CAC, LTV, drop-off points) for executive decision-making.

Objectives

Automate multi-CRM data ingestion (HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive) to ensure fresh, accurate funnel data.
Unify and clean disparate lead and sales data for seamless downstream analysis.
Perform complex SQL analytics across the sales funnel: lead generation, qualification, booking, closing, onboarding.
Calculate and visualize key metrics: conversion rates, drop-off rates, Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), Lifetime Value (LTV), sales cycle time, cohort retention.
Deliver a self-serve dashboard (PowerBI/Tableau) for business leaders, with drill-down capability and real-time updates.
Scope of Work

Data Sourcing: API integration or simulated ingestion from HubSpot, Salesforce, and Pipedrive.
Data Cleaning & Unification: Schema mapping, deduplication, timestamp standardization, and channel/source tagging.
Analytics & Reporting:
Funnel stage analysis via advanced SQL (CTEs, window functions).
Drop-off point identification and root cause hypothesis.
CAC/LTV calculations by channel.
Sales cycle diagnostics and bottleneck detection.
Dashboarding:
PowerBI/Tableau dashboards with customizable filters (date, channel, rep).
Visual KPIs and funnel drop-off breakdowns.
Documentation: Clear README and process documentation for full reproducibility.
